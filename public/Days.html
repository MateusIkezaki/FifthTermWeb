        <h1>Project's Description</h1>
        <p>How to entertain our kids during quarantine? This is what all parents are wondering... So how about a two week 
            challenge full of fun prompts for them to use their energy and creativity? We have developed several different 
            activities for our kids to do and share with their friends. Both members of this group, Manuela and Valentina, have 
            young siblings who have been struggling during quarantine, complaining of boredom, and missing their friends. Wanting 
            to help their brothers and sisters, as well as their parents, Valentina and Manuela have decided to develop a project 
            specifically devoted to kids! We might not notice, but children are definitely struggling with social distancing, 
            and it is not because they do not know how to express their feelings in sentences that they are not feeling this as 
            much as we are! Human contact is extremely important at a young age, it is when children are learning how to work 
            together, interact with each other and communicate with the outside world. We also can't deny that they have a lot of 
            energy to use! That is why Valen and Manu have created a Two Week Challenge full of different activities for them to
            do throughout the day. The challenges vary from drawing to building, hair styling to dressing up, mathematics to sciences… Some of them are purely fun, while others are supposed to teach you while you play! 
            The most exciting part of this challenge is that the kids will be able to share their products and 
            results with their friends! </p>

    <div class="projectdesc">
        <p>Our project will be launched as a course on the SeeSaw platform (equivalent of Canvas, but for the Primary division), 
            and will provide daily activities to the students during their last week of school, as well as game suggestions and 
            Kahoots (online quizzes). Students will be encouraged to document their activities results through videos and 
            pictures, to later share them with their friends. You can access a presentation with further details
